//! Real battery telemetry — ADC1_CH3 on GPIO 4, divider-fed.
//!
//! Per SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-SENSOR §8 and HARDWARE-WIRING-DEVKITC §4.2:
//!   * Two 100 kΩ resistors form a 0.5 divider from VBATT to GND.
//!   * The midpoint goes to GPIO 4 (ADC1_CH3).
//!   * Sample at 12-bit / 12 dB attenuation (esp-idf v5 spelling
//!     `DB_11` is the same value — the chip's full-scale on this
//!     attenuation setting is ~3.1 V).
//!   * Each reading is the median of 16 successive samples to reject
//!     ADC noise.
//!   * Curve-fitting (two-point) calibration is applied so the mV
//!     reading is corrected for the chip's per-unit ADC offset.
//!   * `v_cell_mv = adc_mv × 2` (divider ratio inverse).
//!
//! If ADC init fails (boards without the divider fitted, or a flaky
//! ADC initialisation), we fall back to `BatterySim` so the sender
//! still emits sensible-looking telemetry — the dashboard treats
//! `r2.sensor.battery` as a routine periodic event and a missing
//! battery feed would look like the sensor is broken.

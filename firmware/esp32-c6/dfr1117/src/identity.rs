//! Device identity — per-device Ed25519 keypair, persisted in NVS.
//!
//! Phase 5a / SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-SENSOR §3:
//! On first boot the firmware generates a fresh keypair and stores the
//! 32-byte seed in NVS. On subsequent boots it reloads the same seed,
//! so `device_pk` is stable across reboots and OTA updates (unless a
//! factory reset clears NVS, in which case a new identity is minted).
//!
//! Phase 5 (Track A — `audits/2026-05-23-architectural-gaps.md` finding D):
//! once the sensor completes BLE bootstrap, the dashboard delivers a
//! KeyHolder-signed `DeviceCertificate` over L2CAP as
//! `r2.dash.enrol` (WIRE §2 row 21). The 147-byte cert is persisted
//! to NVS alongside the device key, and surfaced on every announce as
//! CBOR key 8 (WIRE §3.1) so the dashboard can verify the cert chain
//! under `TG_PUB_KEY` instead of TOFU-pinning the announced pk.

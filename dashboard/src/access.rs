//!
//! Owns:
//!   * the in-memory `TrustGroup` (loaded from `tg_priv.bin` at startup),
//!   * the single-use enrolment-token table (5 min expiry, in-memory only
//!     per spec §3.3),
//!   * the helpers that mint a token + its three representations and that
//!     consume one with idempotency on the same `device_pk`.
//!
//! This module is the dashboard-server side of the spec. The webapp side
//! (Access tab, `?join=` handler, IndexedDB persistence) lands in a
//! follow-up slice and consumes the JSON shapes produced here.

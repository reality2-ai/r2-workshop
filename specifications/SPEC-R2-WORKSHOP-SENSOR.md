# SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-SENSOR: Sensor Firmware Behaviour

**Version:** 0.2 Draft
**Date:** 2026-05-12
**Status:** Normative Draft
**Depends on:** SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-WIRE, R2-WIRE, R2-TRUST, R2-BLE, R2-BOOTSTRAP, R2-WIFI, HARDWARE-WIRING (carrier-specific)

---

## 1. Introduction

This specification defines the **runtime behaviour of an r2-workshop
sensor node**: boot and self-test, the state machine, sample
acquisition, SD-card store-and-forward semantics, network behaviour, OTA
update flow, NVS configuration, and error handling.

It builds on `SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-WIRE` (which defines what is sent on the
wire) and is implemented against any of the supported carrier boards
described in `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` (which is an index of carrier-
specific wiring documents — see ADR-001 for the carrier-choice
rationale).

This specification is **carrier-agnostic**: it refers to logical pins
(ADXL355 SPI, battery-sense ADC channel, DRDY, etc.) and points at
the active carrier's wiring document for the physical GPIO numbers.
A new carrier may be added by writing a `HARDWARE-WIRING-<NAME>.md`
file and updating the carrier index — no changes to this
specification are required so long as the carrier's SoC is ESP32-S3.
A different SoC family (ESP32-C6, RP2040, etc.) would require a new
ADR documenting the toolchain and protocol-stack implications.

### 1.1 Scope

In scope:

* Boot sequence and self-test.
* The sensor state machine and LED indication.
* Sample acquisition pipeline (ADXL355 → SD → network).
* Store-and-forward semantics, including reconnect resume.
* Battery monitoring and low-power behaviour.
* Calibration request handling.
* Time-synchronisation reply behaviour.
* Persistent configuration in NVS.
* OTA update flow.
* Error codes and recovery.

Out of scope:

* Wire protocol (`SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-WIRE`).
* Dashboard analytics, calibration math (`SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-DASHBOARD`).
* Hardware reference design (`HARDWARE-WIRING.md`).

### 1.2 Terminology

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHOULD**,
**MAY** in this document are to be interpreted as in RFC 2119.

* **Sensor** — the assembled hardware unit (ESP32-S3 + ADXL355 + SD +
  battery) running the r2-workshop firmware.
* **Firmware** — the Rust binary executing on the ESP32-S3.
* **Sample** — one accelerometer triplet `(x, y, z)` from the ADXL355.
* **SD ring** — the on-card durable log of samples; conceptually a ring
  buffer though physically a set of segment files (§6).
* **Backlog** — `tail_seq − last_acked_seq`: the count of samples in the
  ring not yet acknowledged by the dashboard.
* **TG public key** — the trust-group public key, baked into the firmware
  at compile time (§3).

### 1.3 Notation

Multi-byte integers are stored on SD in little-endian (matches ESP32-S3
native), serialised on the wire in big-endian (per R2-WIRE §1.3). NVS
uses esp-idf's native key/value typing.

---

## 2. Boot and self-test

### 2.1 Boot sequence

On reset the firmware shall execute the following sequence in order. A
failure at any step shall transition to the `ERROR` state (§4.1) with
the corresponding error code (§13.1):

1. ESP-IDF bootloader (unchanged from default).
2. App entry: initialise logger, NVS namespace `"r2-workshop"`.
3. Initialise GPIO (LED pin per `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` §5).
4. Briefly drive LED **white** (boot indicator) for 100 ms.
5. Initialise SPI2 driver (FSPI defaults; see `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` §2.1).
6. Initialise ADXL355 over SPI2; verify WHO_AM_I (`DEVID_AD = 0xAD`,
   `DEVID_MST = 0x1D`, `PARTID = 0xED`). Mismatch → `SPI_FAULT`.
7. Mount SD card via FATFS over SPI2 (CS pin per the active carrier's
   wiring spec; see `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` for the carrier index).
   Failure → `SD_MOUNT_FAIL`.
8. Initialise ADC1 oneshot driver, configure the battery-sense channel
   (channel and GPIO per the active carrier's wiring spec) at 12 dB
   attenuation, 12-bit width.
9. Load device key from NVS; if absent, generate a fresh Ed25519 keypair
   via `esp_fill_random()` and persist (§3.1). NVS errors → `NVS_FAIL`.
10. Load TG public key from compile-time constant (`include_bytes!`
    from `trust_keys/tg_pub.bin`). If the embedded bytes are
    syntactically invalid, the firmware shall refuse to boot — this is
    a build-time bug, not a runtime condition.
11. Read `last_acked_seq` from NVS (default 0 if absent).
12. Scan SD ring tail to determine `tail_seq` (§6.5); set the in-RAM
    `seq` counter to `tail_seq + 1`.
13. Initialise BLE stack (NimBLE) and WiFi STA (esp-idf-svc).
14. Determine the WiFi-credential source per the boot-priority order
    in §2.1.1 below and enter the initial FSM state per §4.2.

### 2.1.1 WiFi-credential boot priority

On every boot the firmware SHALL resolve WiFi credentials in this order
(matching `r2-esp::wifi_prov::load_credentials`):

1. **NVS-stored credentials** (namespace `r2-workshop`, keys `wifi_ssid` +
   `wifi_psk`). Written by a successful BLE bootstrap (§4) and persisted
   across reboots and firmware updates. Cleared by factory reset (§3.1).
2. **Compile-time fallback** from `wifi_config.toml`, if present at
   build time. Dev-only; production builds SHALL omit the file (or
   leave SSID empty), in which case this path returns `None`.
3. **No credentials** → enter `ADVERTISING` and wait for a BLE
   `#wifi_offer`.

The presence of `wifi_config.toml` in a release build SHALL produce a
build-time warning so the dev fallback cannot ship to deployment by
accident. Phase 6 makes BLE the canonical path; the file is retained
only as a workshop debugging escape hatch and SHALL be removed before
the university handoff.

### 2.2 Self-test acceptance

A device SHALL be considered "ready" only if steps 1–14 complete without
error. The self-test result MAY be reported via UART logging during
development; in production, the LED state (any colour other than steady
red) is the indicator that self-test passed.

### 2.3 Watchdog

The hardware watchdog SHALL be enabled with a 30-second timeout. The
main loop shall reset the watchdog at least once per second. A watchdog
expiry triggers a CPU reset; on the subsequent boot the bootloader's
OTA rollback path (§12.7) applies if the previous boot was a recently
flashed image.

---

## 3. Identity and trust

### 3.1 Device key generation

On first boot (no `device_priv` in NVS), the firmware shall generate a
fresh Ed25519 keypair using `esp_fill_random()` for the seed and persist
it to NVS in the `r2-workshop` namespace under keys `device_priv`
(blob, 64 bytes — 32-byte seed + 32-byte public, per ed25519-dalek's
`SigningKey::to_keypair_bytes()` layout) and `device_pub` (blob, 32
bytes).

NVS encryption SHALL be enabled (`CONFIG_NVS_ENCRYPTION=y` in
sdkconfig.defaults) so that physical removal of the flash does not
expose the device's private key.

The device key persists across reboots and across firmware updates. A
factory reset (§12.x via `r2.dash.reset {factory: true}`) erases it,
forcing a fresh identity on next boot.

### 3.2 TG public key

The trust-group public key (32 bytes, Ed25519) shall be embedded in the
firmware via:

```rust
const TG_PUB_KEY: [u8; 32] = *include_bytes!("../trust_keys/tg_pub.bin");
```

(Path relative to the firmware crate root.) The TG cert (if used) is
embedded similarly. Build fails if `trust_keys/tg_pub.bin` is missing.

### 3.3 R2-BEACON class identifier

The firmware SHALL advertise the canonical class string

```
nz.ac.auckland.rocker   →   FNV-1a-32 hash 0x624C47BC
```

in its R2-BEACON legacy AD payload (R2-BEACON §7.3). The hash is what
the dashboard's bootstrap loop matches against (cross-ref
`SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-DASHBOARD.md` §6.3). Both ends MUST agree on the same
string; the FNV-1a-32 derivation is deterministic and verifiable per
R2-FNV. Changing this string is a wire-breaking change and requires a
synchronised update of firmware + dashboard + any vendored r2-bootstrap.

This string identifies the **rocker deployment** of the r2-workshop
template — see SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-ENSEMBLE §2.1. Sibling deployments
(people-counter, gait analysis, …) use distinct class strings
(`nz.ac.auckland.people-counter`, `nz.ac.auckland.gait`, …) and
therefore distinct FNV hash tables, so their traffic doesn't
intermingle with the rocker's even when the radios share spectrum.

The class string baked into the firmware comes from
`trust_keys/sensor_class.txt`. This is the **same string** the
firmware emits as `r2.sensor.announce` key 11 (§3.4) so the dashboard
can recover the class for display + OTA filtering without having to
reverse the hash.

### 3.3.1 Carrier identifier

The firmware SHALL also bake in a **carrier slug** identifying the
physical board variant the binary was compiled for:

| Carrier slug | Build directory                    | Hardware-wiring spec       |
|--------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `devkitc`    | `firmware/esp32-s3/devkitc/`       | `HARDWARE-WIRING-DEVKITC.md` |
| `xiao`       | `firmware/esp32-s3/xiao/`          | `HARDWARE-WIRING-XIAO.md`    |
| *(future)*   | `firmware/esp32-s3/<carrier>/`     | `HARDWARE-WIRING-<NAME>.md`  |

Each carrier directory's `Cargo.toml` SHALL declare the slug in a
`[package.metadata.r2-workshop]` table:

```toml
[package.metadata.r2-workshop]
carrier = "devkitc"   # or "xiao", etc.
```

The build script (`tools/build-firmware.sh`) reads this metadata,
exports it as a `R2_WORKSHOP_CARRIER` env var at compile time, and
the firmware embeds it as a `&'static str` constant emitted at
announce time (`r2.sensor.announce` key 12).

The carrier slug is the canonical identifier for **OTA matching**:
the dashboard refuses to push a firmware whose carrier slug doesn't
match the target sensor's announce (§13.4 of DASHBOARD).

### 3.4 Announce signature

On TCP connect to the dashboard, the firmware shall transmit
`r2.sensor.announce` (per WIRE §3.1) with `sig` computed as:

```
canonical = canonical_cbor_encode({
    0: device_pk,
    1: hostname,
    2: fw_ver,
    3: last_seq,
    4: boot_ts_ms,
    5: nonce
})
sig = ed25519_sign(device_priv, canonical)
```

The dashboard SHALL verify this signature according to the trust mode
the sensor is operating in (§3.5):

* **Post-cert mode** (the normative target since Phase 5 cert-issuance
  landed) — the announce carries an additional CBOR key
  `8: device_cert` (see WIRE §3.1) holding the 147-byte
  KeyHolder-signed `DeviceCertificate`. The dashboard verifies the
  cert chain against `TG_PUB_KEY` and verifies the announce signature
  against the cert's `device_public_key` field. A mismatch (cert
  for a different pk, expired cert, revoked cert, or invalid cert
  signature) rejects the announce.
* **Legacy TOFU mode** (for firmware that pre-dates Phase 5
  cert-issuance, retained for one release of mixed-fleet
  compatibility) — the announce omits key `8`. The dashboard
  accepts any well-formed Ed25519 signature on the canonical
  payload above and logs the device_pk to its accept-list (trust
  on first use). The dashboard's `[events]` log marks these
  `tofu` so the operator can see which fleet members are still on
  legacy firmware.

Implementations conforming to the post-cert mode SHALL emit cert
material on every announce (i.e. on every TCP reconnect to the
dashboard). The dashboard is stateless on this point — a sensor
that omits key `8` mid-deployment immediately drops back to TOFU
in the dashboard's log.

### 3.5 Device certificate

The dashboard SHALL issue a KeyHolder-signed `DeviceCertificate`
to each sensor it accepts. The cryptographic call is identical to
the browser-viewer enrolment path
(`r2_trust::TrustGroup::process_join_request`, see
SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-ACCESS §4) — transport-agnostic. The transport
choice is implementation-defined:

**v0.1 path — post-announce, over TCP (default):** the sensor
first connects to the dashboard over TCP:21042 and sends a
cert-less `r2.sensor.announce` (no CBOR key 8). The dashboard
verifies under TOFU (§3.4 legacy mode), runs
`process_join_request(device_pk, ...)`, serialises the resulting
147-byte cert, and writes it as an `r2.dash.enrol` R2-WIRE
compact frame down the same TCP socket. The sensor's
`dispatch_inbound` matches `r2.dash.enrol`, validates the cert
under its embedded `TG_PUB_KEY`, validates that the cert's
`device_public_key` matches its own `device_pk`, and persists
the cert bytes to NVS under key `device_cert` (§3.6). From the
sensor's *next* TCP reconnect (or reboot) onwards, every
announce carries the cert at CBOR key `8` and the dashboard
switches to cert-anchored verification.

**v0.2 path — pre-WiFi, over BLE L2CAP CoC (forward-looking):**
during BLE bootstrap, before `#wifi_offer`, the sensor sends a
sensor-initiated L2CAP frame carrying its `device_pk`; the
dashboard responds with `r2.dash.enrol` over the same L2CAP
channel; the sensor persists the cert before WiFi creds arrive,
so the very first TCP announce already carries the cert. This
path is the eventual target (the sensor's L2CAP loop already
accepts `r2.dash.enrol` — see `firmware/.../main.rs`) but
requires a new sensor→dashboard `r2.sensor.hello_pk` event that
is out of scope for v0.1.

Cert delivery is one-shot per device per cert. The sensor MAY
re-bootstrap (via `cycle_hotspot` or factory reset) and receive
a fresh cert under the same `device_pk`; the dashboard MAY issue
a new cert with a later `issued_at` and the sensor SHALL accept
it if the chain verifies. The dashboard SHOULD skip re-issuing a
cert when the sensor's announce already carries a valid one
under the current TG (i.e. the announce arrived in post-cert
mode, §3.4).

### 3.6 Persistence

The sensor's NVS namespace `r2_workshop` stores:

| Key | Type | Bytes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `device_priv` | bytes | 32 | Ed25519 secret-key seed; never leaves the device |
| `device_cert` | bytes | 147 | KeyHolder-signed `DeviceCertificate` (§3.5). Optional — absent on first boot before bootstrap, optional on legacy firmware. |
| `tg_pk` | bytes | 32 | (optional cache) TG public key extracted from the cert at receipt; used to short-circuit re-derivation. |

Total NVS budget: 211 bytes per device. The carrier's NVS
partition is 24 KiB (per `partitions.csv`); this is negligible.

---

## 4. State machine

### 4.1 States

| State | LED indication | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IDLE` | white briefly, then dark | Boot complete; no networking active |
| `ADVERTISING` | blue, slow pulse (1 Hz) | BLE beacon active, awaiting bootstrap |
| `BLE_CONNECTED` | cyan, fast pulse | L2CAP up, awaiting `#wifi_offer` |
| `WIFI_CONNECTING` | cyan→yellow flicker | Joining hotspot, DHCP, TCP handshake |
| `STREAMING_LIVE` | green, heartbeat (60 bpm) | TCP up, sample-to-frame latency ≤ 2 periods |
| `STREAMING_CATCHUP` | yellow, heartbeat | TCP up, draining backlog ≥ 200 samples |
| `CALIBRATING` | purple, solid | Averaging samples for a `cal.sample.req` |
| `LOW_BATTERY` | orange, slow pulse (overlay) | Cell ≤ 3.3 V; overrides other state colour |
| `OTA` | white, fast strobe | Firmware update in progress |
| `ERROR` | red, fast pulse | Fatal init or runtime fault; manual reset required |

The LED indication conforms to `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` §5 mapping. States
that overlay (only `LOW_BATTERY`) take precedence over the colour of the
underlying state but do not change the underlying state.

### 4.1.1 Wire encoding

Each state has a stable `u8` value carried in the `r2.sensor.status`
event (key `0`) per `SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-WIRE` §3. The dashboard's WASM
viewer keys its virtual-LED CSS class off this value (`ledClassFor` in
`webapp/index.html`), so the on-screen indicator follows the
physical RGB LED in lockstep.

| Value | State | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `BOOT` | Brief startup state, white flash. v0.1 firmware emits this immediately at startup; equivalent to the `IDLE` cell in §4.1 (the spec's `IDLE` is the post-boot, pre-networking moment, with the same operational meaning). |
| 1 | `ADVERTISING` | |
| 2 | `BLE_CONNECTED` | |
| 3 | `WIFI_CONNECTING` | |
| 4 | `STREAMING_LIVE` | Default once WiFi + TCP are healthy. |
| 5 | `STREAMING_CATCHUP` | |
| 6 | `CALIBRATING` | |
| 7 | `LOW_BATTERY` | Overlay: when active, the wire-emitted state is `LOW_BATTERY` regardless of the underlying primary state. The dashboard treats this as an overlay (orange dot wins over the primary state's colour) and surfaces "Battery low" text per `feedback_a11y_indicators`. |
| 8 | `OTA` | |
| 9 | `ERROR` | |

Values 10–255 are reserved for future states (e.g. fine-grained error
sub-codes per `feedback_a11y_indicators`'s pattern-based encoding —
red rhythm A = ADXL fault, rhythm B = SD fault, etc.). Receivers
SHOULD render an unknown state as the inert grey placeholder + the
literal numeric value in any text status, not as a default-to-online
hint.

The canonical source for this enum is
`firmware/esp32-s3/src/led.rs::LedState`; the dashboard side is
`webapp/index.html`'s `ledClassFor()` switch. The two MUST stay
in sync; PLAN row Z's wire-vector audit cross-checks this.

### 4.2 Transitions

```

Persistence rules:

* `WIFI_CONNECTING` SHALL write the accepted SSID + PSK to NVS keys
  `wifi_ssid` + `wifi_psk` (namespace `r2-workshop`) on the **first**
  successful TCP+announce round-trip — not before. This avoids
  persisting a working WiFi association that happens to be unable to
  reach a dashboard.
* On any subsequent boot, those NVS creds become the §2.1.1 first-tier
  candidate; ADVERTISING is skipped unless they fail.
* A factory reset (§3.1, via `r2.dash.reset {factory: true}` OR a long
  RESET button hold) clears `wifi_ssid` + `wifi_psk` along with the
  device key, forcing a fresh BLE bootstrap on the next boot.

Additional transitions:

* `STREAMING_LIVE` ↔ `STREAMING_CATCHUP` based on backlog (§7.3).
* `STREAMING_LIVE` → `CALIBRATING` on `r2.dash.cal.sample.req`; back
  after the response is sent.
* Any state → `LOW_BATTERY` (overlay) when battery voltage ≤ 3.3 V; the
  underlying state continues to operate. Cleared when voltage > 3.4 V
  (hysteresis).
* Any state → `OTA` on `r2.dash.fw.update`; transitions to a fresh boot
  on success or back to the prior state on rollback.
* `STREAMING_LIVE` → `ADVERTISING` when the network task observes
  3 consecutive TCP-write failures or 5 s of no `r2.dash.ack` reception
  during keep-alive (KeepAlive condition; analogous to the M10 demo
  behaviour — see `r2-core/demos/rocker-rig/README.md`).
* Any state at battery ≤ 3.0 V → safe shutdown (§8.4): persist
  `last_acked_seq`, flush SD, deep-sleep with a wake-on-charger condition.

## 5. Sample acquisition

### 5.1 ADXL355 driver

The firmware shall provide a driver module exposing:

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `init(spi, range, odr) -> Result<Driver>` | Soft reset, set `RANGE` (0x2C), set `FILTER` (0x28) ODR bits, clear `POWER_CTL.STANDBY` (0x2D bit 0). |
| `who_am_i() -> Result<(u8, u8, u8)>` | Read `DEVID_AD` (0x00), `DEVID_MST` (0x01), `PARTID` (0x02). Expected `(0xAD, 0x1D, 0xED)`. |
| `read_xyz() -> Result<(i32, i32, i32)>` | Burst-read 9 bytes from `XDATA3` (0x08); decode three 20-bit signed values, sign-extend to `i32`. |
| `set_range(r)`, `set_odr(o)` | Runtime reconfiguration. |

SPI command framing (per ADXL355 datasheet): byte 1 = `(addr << 1) | RW`,
where `RW = 1` for read and `0` for write; bytes 2..N are data. SCLK
polarity / phase: SPI mode 0 (CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0). Maximum SCLK 10 MHz.

20-bit sample reconstruction:

```
raw_unsigned = (xdata3 << 12) | (xdata2 << 4) | (xdata1 >> 4)
raw_signed   = sign_extend_20bit(raw_unsigned)
```

### 5.2 Sample loop

The firmware shall sample at the configured `rate_hz` (default 100 Hz,
NVS-tunable). Two acquisition modes are permitted:

* **DRDY-triggered** (preferred at high rates): the ADXL355 DRDY pin
  (GPIO per the active carrier's wiring spec — see
  `HARDWARE-WIRING.md`) ISR triggers a task that performs the burst
  read.
* **Polled at fixed period** (acceptable for ≤ 200 Hz): a periodic
  FreeRTOS timer fires at `1/rate_hz`.

The implementation shall measure jitter and reject samples whose
inter-sample interval exceeds `2 / rate_hz` (i.e. dropped samples are
detected and counted; `r2.sensor.event.log {code: SAMPLE_DROP, …}` shall
be emitted on every 100 dropped samples).

### 5.3 Sequence number

Per WIRE §5.1, `seq` is a per-device monotonic 32-bit counter that
persists across reboots:

* On boot, `seq` is initialised to `tail_seq + 1` where `tail_seq` is
  the highest `seq` found in the SD ring (§6.5).
* The sample task increments `seq` by 1 per sample written to SD —
  *not* per sample sent on the wire.
* On wrap (every ~1.4 years at 100 Hz), the firmware shall emit
  `r2.sensor.event.log {code: SEQ_WRAP, …}` 24 hours before reaching
  `0xFFFFFFF0` and continue counting through 0.

### 5.4 Timestamp

> **AMENDED BY [SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-TIMESYNC](SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-TIMESYNC.md)
> §2.2**: post-Phase-5 firmware emits `ts_ms` as synchronised
> deployment milliseconds (a 32-bit-wide window into the dashboard's
> wall-clock-aligned timeline), not monotonic uptime. Per TIMESYNC
> §2.5, SD-record semantics follow the post-amendment meaning. The
> "monotonic uptime" description below is preserved for legacy
> firmware that has not yet received `r2.dash.set_clock_offset`.

`ts_ms` is a 32-bit monotonic uptime counter in milliseconds, captured
at sample-read time using `esp_timer_get_time() / 1000`. Wraps every
~49 days; the dashboard's per-device offset (WIRE §7) accommodates wraps
implicitly because the wrap manifests as a one-off backwards jump that
exceeds normal smoothing.

## 6. SD store-and-forward

### 6.1 Filesystem layout

The SD card shall be formatted FAT32 (or FATFS-compatible exFAT for
cards > 32 GB) with allocation-unit size 32 kB.

The firmware writes segments directly under the SD-card mount point
(spec v0.1 deviation — see note below):

```
/sdcard/
├─ log0001.csv      ← rolling-ring segment 1 (oldest)
├─ log0002.csv      ← rolling-ring segment 2
├─ log0003.csv      ← rolling-ring segment 3 (current write target)
├─ meta.bin         ← head_seq, tail_seq, last_acked_seq snapshot
├─ captures/       ← named experimental captures (SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-CAPTURE)
│  ├─ 0001779000000000-run-01.csv
│  └─ 0001779000003000-run-02.csv
└─ fw.bak/          ← OTA rollback image (optional, §12.8)
```

The rolling ring (`logNNNN.csv`) and the named captures
(`captures/<ts16>-<name>.csv`, per SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-CAPTURE)
**SHALL** coexist. The ring is the always-on durable backstop
for the live stream and writes raw (uncalibrated) samples; the
captures directory holds operator-named experimental runs with
calibration offsets applied. Neither one is conditional on the
other being present.

Segments are named `logNNNN.csv` with a 4-digit zero-padded counter,
incrementing forever (no reuse).

**v0.1 → v0.2 implementation deviations from the original spec layout**:

* Original spec placed segments under `/r2/`. The implementation puts
  them at the mount root because ESP-IDF's FATFS layer doesn't
  reliably create subdirectories from `std::fs::create_dir_all` — the
  call returns Ok without actually creating the directory, then
  subsequent file opens fail with EINVAL. Cosmetic deviation; the
  wire format and record layout are unchanged. To be revisited once
  ESP-IDF's `mkdir` path is shown to be reliable (or we route around it
  via direct FATFS calls).
* Original spec named segments `log.NNNN.bin` (two dots — a base, a
  counter, and an extension). The implementation uses `logNNNN.csv`
  (single dot, strict 8.3-compatible, `.csv` extension reflecting the
  v0.2 fixed-width-CSV record format) because ESP-IDF's FATFS LFN
  support rejects multi-dot filenames with EINVAL.
* Original spec specified a fixed 20-byte binary record. v0.2 stores
  fixed-width CSV (see §6.2). The motivation is that a pulled SD card
  is now readable in any text editor / pandas / Excel without the
  university having to write a custom parser — and the standalone
  `ts_ms` value in each row is interpretable without a side file.

### 6.2 Record format

Each sample is appended as a fixed-width CSV row of exactly 62 bytes:

```text
       seq,         ts_ms,          x,          y,          z\n
^----10----^^-----14-----^^----11----^^----11----^^----11----^
```

Columns:

| Column | Width | Type      | Notes                                                      |
|--------|-------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `seq`  | 10    | u32 ASCII | Right-aligned, space-padded. Matches the wire `seq` field. |
| `ts_ms`| 14    | i64 ASCII | Right-aligned, space-padded. Sign character counts toward the 14 chars when negative. Carries the synchronised clock value per SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-TIMESYNC §2.2 — interpretable standalone (no side file needed). |
| `x,y,z`| 11 ea | i32 ASCII | Right-aligned, space-padded. Raw ADXL355 LSB values (±8 388 607 at ±2 g range). |

Columns are separated by single commas (`,`) and rows by a single
newline (`\n`). No CRLF. No header row. Every row is exactly 62 bytes
so `seek(record_index × 62)` remains valid for boot recovery.

Readers MAY use any whitespace-tolerant CSV reader. For pandas:
`pd.read_csv(path, header=None, names=['seq','ts_ms','x','y','z'],
skipinitialspace=True)`.

### 6.2.1 fsync cadence

FATFS-on-ESP-IDF buffers writes in RAM. Without an explicit `fsync`,
data — and even the FAT directory entries linking to it — can be
absent from the card when the operator pulls it without an orderly
shutdown. The firmware shall therefore call `sync_all()` on the
current segment:

* every **100 records** (≈ 1 s at 100 Hz);
* on every **segment rotation** (before closing the outgoing
  segment);
* on **`Drop`** (e.g. before `esp_restart()`).

This bounds worst-case loss on hot SD removal to roughly one second of
samples. The cadence is not configurable in v0.2 — operator-supervised
rig tolerates the fixed value; making it NVS-tunable is a follow-up if
the cost per fsync turns out to dominate sample-rate margin.

### 6.3 Segment rotation

A new segment shall be opened when the current segment reaches
`segment_size_bytes` (default 8 MiB ≈ 135,316 records ≈ 22.5 minutes
at 100 Hz given the 62-byte CSV record). The default is configurable
via NVS key `segment_size_mb` (u8, default 8).

The firmware shall retain at most `ring_segments` segments (default 12,
NVS-tunable). When opening a new segment causes the count to exceed
`ring_segments`, the **oldest** segment is deleted (overwrite-oldest,
per PLAN D-15). Default ring size: 12 × 8 MiB = 96 MiB ≈ 14 hours at
100 Hz.

### 6.4 ACK persistence

`last_acked_seq` is updated on every received `r2.dash.ack` but
persisted to NVS at most **once per second** (rate-limited). This bounds
NVS write wear at ≤ 86,400 writes/day. On any clean shutdown, the
firmware shall flush `last_acked_seq` to NVS.

A snapshot of `(head_seq, tail_seq, last_acked_seq)` is also written to
`/r2/meta.bin` once per minute as a fallback if NVS is corrupted.

### 6.5 Boot recovery

On boot, the firmware shall:

1. Enumerate `logNNNN.csv` segments at the SD mount root, sort by
   segment number.
2. Open the highest-numbered segment, divide its size by 62 to obtain
   the record count, seek to `(count - 1) × 62`, read the first 10
   bytes (the `seq` column), trim whitespace, parse as u32 to obtain
   `tail_seq`.
3. Set the in-RAM `seq` counter to `tail_seq + 1`.
4. Read `last_acked_seq` from NVS; if absent, fall back to
   `/r2/meta.bin`; if both absent, treat as 0 (full retransmission of
   the ring on next connect).

Leftover `.bin` segments from prior firmware versions are ignored on
boot; operators may delete them manually. They do not block fresh
`.csv` segments because the segment counter sequence is independent
across format generations.

### 6.6 Reconnect replay

When the network task (re)connects to the dashboard, it shall resume
sending from `last_acked_seq + 1`. The dashboard's `r2.dash.ack` after
`r2.sensor.announce` (WIRE §3.1) MAY override this with a different
`through_seq` — the firmware shall accept this and adjust its ring
freeing accordingly.

### 6.7 SD failure handling

If a write to SD fails (write error, card removed), the firmware shall:

1. Emit `r2.sensor.event.log {level: ERROR, code: SD_WRITE_FAIL, …}` if
   network is up.
2. Continue sampling into a small in-RAM bounded queue (default 1024
   samples ≈ 10 s at 100 Hz) and retry SD writes every 100 ms.
3. If SD recovery does not occur within 30 s, transition to `ERROR`
   state — durability is the primary contract; running without
   durability is not acceptable.

---

## 7. Network task

### 7.1 Connection management

The network task is started after `WIFI_CONNECTING` succeeds (DHCP
complete). It performs:

1. TCP connect to the gateway IP (received in `#wifi_offer`) on port
   21042. Connection failure: retry with exponential backoff (1 s, 2 s,
   4 s, 8 s, 16 s, capped at 30 s).
2. Send `r2.sensor.announce` (WIRE §3.1).
3. Await `r2.dash.ack` from the dashboard within 5 s — failure to
   receive transitions back to `ADVERTISING`.
4. Begin draining the SD ring from `last_acked_seq + 1`.

### 7.2 Live mode

In `STREAMING_LIVE`, each sample written to SD by the sample task is
also (effectively concurrently) emitted as a single
`r2.sensor.acceleration` frame (WIRE §3.2). The implementation MAY
batch up to 4 samples in a single TCP write call to reduce syscall
overhead, provided each sample remains in its own R2-WIRE frame.

### 7.3 Catch-up mode

The network task shall switch to `STREAMING_CATCHUP` when:

```
backlog = tail_seq − last_acked_seq ≥ 200
```

In catch-up mode, it shall emit `r2.sensor.acceleration.batch` (WIRE
§3.3) with up to 50 samples per frame.

The network task shall return to `STREAMING_LIVE` when:

```
backlog ≤ 50
```

The hysteresis (200 enter, 50 exit) prevents thrashing.

### 7.4 ACK reception

The network task shall continuously read incoming dashboard frames in a
non-blocking manner. On `r2.dash.ack`:

* Update `last_acked_seq` in RAM.
* Schedule a rate-limited NVS write (§6.4).
* Free SD segments where every record's `seq ≤ last_acked_seq` —
  release-by-deletion, atomic per segment.

On `r2.dash.cal.sample.req`, `r2.dash.stream.start`, `r2.dash.stream.stop`,
`r2.dash.sync_pulse`, `r2.dash.config.set`, `r2.dash.fw.update`,
`r2.dash.reset`: dispatch to the appropriate handler (§9, §11, §10, §12).

### 7.5 KeepAlive

If no `r2.dash.ack` is received within 5 s while streaming, the network
task shall send a `r2.sensor.status` frame as a keep-alive probe. If
no traffic returns within a further 5 s, the task closes the TCP
session and transitions to `ADVERTISING` (the M10 demo's KeepAlive
pattern).

---

## 8. Battery monitoring

### 8.1 Sampling

The battery-sense ADC channel (ADC1, channel and GPIO per the active
carrier's wiring spec — see `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` for the carrier
index) shall be sampled at 12-bit resolution with 12 dB attenuation
(full-scale ≈ 3.1 V). The channel MUST be on ADC1, not ADC2 — ADC2
is unusable while WiFi is active. Each battery reading shall be the
median of 16 successive samples to reject ADC noise.

ADC calibration via esp-idf's two-point calibration scheme is REQUIRED
to remove the ADC's manufacturing offset (`esp_adc_cal_characterize` or
`adc_cali_create_scheme_*`).

#### 8.1.1 Plausibility / variance fallback

The 16-sample reading SHALL be subjected to two gates before being
trusted:

* **Plausibility window** — scaled cell voltage MUST fall within
  `[2500, 4500] mV`. A single-cell LiPo cannot operate outside this
  band; a value outside the window means either no divider is fitted
  for this build (floating ADC pin) or the divider has a broken
  connection.
* **Variance threshold** — the spread (`max − min`) across the 16
  samples within one reading MUST be ≤ `100 mV` in calibrated mV.
  Wider spreads indicate the ADC sample-and-hold did not acquire the
  source within its sample window — typically a high-impedance
  divider with the bypass cap missing (see
  `HARDWARE-WIRING-DEVKITC.md` §4.2).

When either gate fails on the FIRST reading of a boot, the
implementation MUST emit a warn-level log line explaining the failure
mode and FALL BACK to the configured `BatterySim` (§8.3 curve still
applies) for that boot. Once a real reading has passed both gates, the
implementation MAY trust subsequent reads without re-gating (single
sample-noise spikes shouldn't flap LED state between sim drift and
live cell voltage). The decision latches per-boot.

The fallback exists so that a single firmware binary can run
correctly across the mix of boards an operator typically has on the
bench: some fitted with a working divider, some without, some in
intermediate states of bring-up.

### 8.2 Voltage reconstruction

Cell voltage in millivolts:

```
v_cell_mv = adc_calibrated_mv × 2     # divider ratio = 2 (100k / 100k)
```

### 8.3 State of charge

Percentage shall be computed via piecewise-linear interpolation of:

| Cell mV | Percent |
|---|---|
| 4200 | 100 |
| 4100 | 90 |
| 4000 | 80 |
| 3900 | 65 |
| 3800 | 50 |
| 3700 | 35 |
| 3600 | 20 |
| 3500 | 10 |
| 3400 | 5 |
| 3300 | 0 |

This curve is approximate; refine empirically once the chosen LiPo cell
is in hand. Implementations SHOULD treat the curve as a config-time
constant, not hard-coded.

### 8.4 Low-battery behaviour

| Cell mV | Action |
|---|---|
| ≤ 3300 | Enter `LOW_BATTERY` overlay (LED orange). Continue streaming. Emit `r2.sensor.battery` immediately, then every 10 s. |
| ≤ 3100 | Reduce sample rate to 10 Hz to extend runtime. |
| ≤ 3000 | Safe shutdown: flush `last_acked_seq` and `meta.bin`, send a final `r2.sensor.event.log {code: BATTERY_CRITICAL}` if network up, halt the CPU. The operator unplugs the depleted cell and connects a fresh charged cell; this triggers a cold boot per §2.1. There is no on-board charging — the sensor does not "wake from sleep on charger connect." |
| ≥ 3400 | Clear `LOW_BATTERY` overlay (hysteresis). |

### 8.5 Reporting cadence

Per WIRE §3.4: every 30 s in `STREAMING_*` states, every 5 minutes
otherwise. Plus immediate transmission on entering `LOW_BATTERY`.

---

## 9. Calibration handling

On `r2.dash.cal.sample.req` (WIRE §4.2):

1. The firmware enters `CALIBRATING` state if currently in
   `STREAMING_LIVE`. If in any other state, it replies with
   `r2.sensor.status {error_code: CAL_INVALID_STATE}` and remains
   unchanged.
2. The firmware continues sampling at the configured rate; in parallel
   it accumulates `(x, y, z)` triplets into running sums for `req.ms`
   milliseconds.
3. Streaming MAY pause during the averaging window if SD throughput is
   limited; the implementation SHOULD prefer durability over streaming
   here (the dashboard tolerates a brief gap, marked via `seq`).
4. After the window closes, compute arithmetic means
   `(gx, gy, gz)` per axis.
5. Emit `r2.sensor.cal.sample.resp` (WIRE §3.6) with the means and the
   actual `n_samples` counted.
6. Transition back to `STREAMING_LIVE`.

The firmware does not store the calibration result; the dashboard owns
the calibration matrix per PLAN D-16.

---

## 10. Time synchronisation

On `r2.dash.sync_pulse` (WIRE §4.5), the firmware shall:

1. Capture `sensor_ts_ms = esp_timer_get_time() / 1000` **immediately**
   on frame receipt (before any other processing).
2. Reply with `r2.sensor.sync_pong {req_id, sensor_ts_ms}` (WIRE §3.7).

The sensor's clock is never adjusted. The dashboard maintains the
per-device offset and applies it on its side (WIRE §7).

---

## 11. NVS configuration

### 11.1 Persistent items

Namespace: `"r2-workshop"`. All keys are ASCII; encryption per §3.1.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `device_priv` | blob(64) | (gen first boot) | Ed25519 keypair bytes |
| `device_pub` | blob(32) | (derived) | Ed25519 public key |
| `hostname` | string | `"rocker-{6-hex of device_pk[..6]}"` | Friendly device name |
| `default_rate_hz` | u16 | 100 | Sample rate when streaming starts |
| `default_range` | u8 | 0 | 0=±2 g, 1=±4 g, 2=±8 g |
| `mounting_role` | u8 | 1 | 1=rocker, 2=bed, 3=other |
| `last_acked_seq` | u32 | 0 | ACK pointer (rate-limited writes) |
| `segment_size_mb` | u8 | 8 | SD ring segment size |
| `ring_segments` | u8 | 12 | Number of segments retained |
| `boot_count` | u32 | 0 | Incremented every boot — diagnostic |

### 11.2 Updates via `r2.dash.config.set`

On receipt of `r2.dash.config.set` (WIRE §4.6), the firmware shall
update each present field in NVS and apply the change:

* `default_rate_hz`, `default_range` — apply on next `stream.start`.
* `hostname`, `mounting_role` — apply immediately; the change is
  visible to the dashboard on the next frame's metadata or status.

The firmware shall reply with a `r2.sensor.status` confirming the new
values.

---

## 12. OTA

### 12.1 Trigger

On `r2.dash.fw.update` (WIRE §4.7), the firmware shall transition to
`OTA` state and:

1. Fetch the binary from the URL via TCP. Bytes-as-they-arrive are fed
   into `esp_ota_write` against the `OTA_NEXT` partition.
2. Compute SHA-256 streamingly during the fetch.
3. On EOF, compare the computed SHA-256 against `req.sha256`; mismatch
   → abort, free the partition, return to prior state, emit
   `r2.sensor.event.log {code: OTA_VERIFY_FAIL}`.
4. If `req.tg_sig` is present, verify it (Ed25519 over `(url || sha256)`)
   against `TG_PUB_KEY`; failure → abort as above. In v0.1, absence
   of `tg_sig` SHALL emit a warning log but is not fatal.
5. Mark the new partition as boot via `esp_ota_set_boot_partition`.
6. Reboot.

### 12.2 First-boot rollback

On the first boot of a freshly flashed image, the firmware shall
remain in a "tentative" state (`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback`
deferred) until:

* Self-test (§2) passes.
* TCP connection to the dashboard succeeds.
* At least one `r2.dash.ack` is received.

Only then does the firmware mark the new partition as valid. If any
of these conditions fails within 60 s of first boot, the bootloader's
rollback path returns to the previous partition.

### 12.3 SD-backed backup (informative, v1.0)

A future version SHOULD copy the running firmware image to `/r2/fw.bak/`
during the OTA flow and provide a manual rollback path via
`r2.dash.reset` with a flag, for cases where automatic rollback fails.

### 12.4 Carrier-mismatch fail-safe

The sensor SHALL refuse to write a binary whose embedded carrier
slug differs from its own running carrier — independently of any
dashboard-side validation gate (SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-DASHBOARD §13.4).
This is the last line of defence: an operator who forces a manual
push past the dashboard's red double-confirm still has the sensor
refuse to brick itself.

**Implementation hook.** The firmware build pipeline writes the
`class` + `carrier` strings into a known-offset metadata section
adjacent to the standard `esp_app_desc_t` block (which already
lives at a fixed offset inside every ESP-IDF app image). The OTA
receiver:

1. Buffers the first ≥ 1 KiB of the incoming binary in RAM.
2. Locates the metadata block by magic (`"R2WORKSHOP"` ASCII +
   a u8 version byte = 0x01).
3. Reads the `carrier` field (≤ 32 bytes, NUL-padded).
4. Compares to its own compile-time `CARRIER` constant.
5. On mismatch: discard the buffer, free the OTA partition,
   emit `r2.sensor.event.log {code: OTA_CARRIER_MISMATCH (0x52)}`,
   return to prior state.

`class` mismatch is logged for diagnostics but does NOT abort the
flash — re-classing a sensor (e.g. moving a device from one
deployment's TG to another) is a valid operator intent. Carrier
mismatch, by contrast, is almost always either operator error or a
build-pipeline bug, and the cost of bricking the sensor is high.

The metadata block layout (little-endian):

```
+0   "R2WORKSHOP"   10 bytes ASCII magic
+10  version        u8       = 0x01
+11  reserved       u8       = 0x00
+12  class_len      u8       ≤ 64
+13  class          ASCII    NUL-padded to 64 bytes
+77  carrier_len    u8       ≤ 32
+78  carrier        ASCII    NUL-padded to 32 bytes
+110 build_ts_ms    u64      epoch-ms at build time
+118 (reserved, NUL through to next 16-byte boundary)
```

128 bytes total. The build script emits this block via a linker
symbol with a `#[link_section]` attribute on a Rust `static`, so
the offset within the .bin is stable across builds.

---

## 13. Errors

### 13.1 Codes

The firmware emits `r2.sensor.event.log` with one of the codes below;
codes ≥ 0xF0 trigger `ERROR` state.

| Code | Name | Severity | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | NONE | — | — |
| 0x10 | SAMPLE_DROP | warn | Continue; logged once per 100 drops |
| 0x11 | DRDY_TIMEOUT | warn | Re-init ADXL355; retry 3× then 0xF1 |
| 0x20 | SD_WRITE_FAIL | error | RAM buffer + retry; 0xF2 if 30 s no recovery |
| 0x21 | SD_RING_DELETE_FAIL | warn | Continue; ring may grow until next success |
| 0x30 | NVS_WRITE_FAIL | error | Continue (cached in RAM); 0xF3 on read fault |
| 0x40 | TG_SIG_FAIL | warn | Dashboard rejected announce; continue advertising |
| 0x50 | OTA_FETCH_FAIL | warn | Return to prior state |
| 0x51 | OTA_VERIFY_FAIL | warn | Return to prior state |
| 0x52 | OTA_CARRIER_MISMATCH | warn | Return to prior state — sensor-side fail-safe per §12.4 |
| 0x60 | BATTERY_LOW | warn | LOW_BATTERY overlay |
| 0x61 | BATTERY_CRITICAL | error | Safe shutdown |
| 0x70 | SEQ_WRAP_IMMINENT | info | None — informational, 24 h pre-wrap |
| 0xF1 | SPI_FAULT | fatal | ERROR state |
| 0xF2 | SD_FATAL | fatal | ERROR state |
| 0xF3 | NVS_FATAL | fatal | ERROR state |
| 0xFF | UNKNOWN | fatal | ERROR state |

### 13.2 ERROR state

In `ERROR` state, the firmware shall:

* Set LED to red, fast pulse.
* Stop sampling, stop streaming, stop networking.
* Continue UART logging.
* Wait for manual reset; the watchdog will not save us here, since the
  main loop is intentionally idle.

A future version MAY support remote `r2.dash.reset` from `ERROR` state
to allow remote recovery without site visit; v0.1 requires physical
power-cycle.

---

## 14. Conformance

A firmware build conforms to this specification when the following
acceptance tests pass on the reference hardware:

### 14.1 Self-test acceptance

1. Cold boot completes within 5 s.
2. WHO_AM_I read returns `(0xAD, 0x1D, 0xED)`.
3. SD card mount succeeds with a known-good FAT32 card.
4. NVS namespace `r2-workshop` is readable and writable.
5. Device generates a valid Ed25519 keypair on first boot and reuses it
   on subsequent boots.
6. LED transitions from white (boot) to the appropriate steady-state
   colour within 1 s of boot completion.

### 14.2 Sample-loop acceptance

1. With ADXL355 stationary and level on bench, mean `(x, y, z)` over
   5 s reads `(0, 0, ≈ 256000)` LSB ± 10% at ±2 g range (gravity = 1 g
   on z-axis).
2. Sample-rate jitter (max inter-sample interval / nominal) ≤ 1.5×
   under unloaded conditions.
3. `seq` increments by 1 per SD record.
4. After power cycle, the new `seq` equals `tail_seq + 1` of the
   pre-shutdown ring.

### 14.3 Network acceptance

1. Connect to a dummy dashboard simulator on port 21042; complete
   announce + first ACK within 1 s of WiFi up.
2. Live mode: emitted-frame `seq` matches written-record `seq` for
   contiguous samples; latency ≤ 2 sample periods.
3. Catch-up mode: with a 1000-sample backlog injected, drain to live
   mode within 10 s on a 5 Mbit/s link.
4. ACK reception frees SD segments idempotently — no
   `SD_RING_DELETE_FAIL` errors over 1 hour of continuous operation.

### 14.4 Calibration acceptance

1. On `cal.sample.req {position: A, ms: 1000}`, response received
   within 1.2 s with `n_samples` ≥ 90 at 100 Hz.
2. Mean `(gx, gy, gz)` reproducible within 1% across 5 successive
   requests with the device static.

### 14.5 Battery acceptance

1. Reported `voltage_mv` is within ±50 mV of voltmeter-measured cell
   voltage across the 3.0–4.2 V range.
2. `LOW_BATTERY` overlay engages within 1 s of cell ≤ 3.3 V.
3. Safe shutdown sequence completes (NVS flushed, deep sleep entered)
   within 3 s of cell ≤ 3.0 V.

### 14.6 OTA acceptance

1. Successfully OTA-update from build N to build N+1 with no data loss
   in `last_acked_seq` or SD ring.
2. Deliberate corruption of the binary causes verification failure
   without overwriting the running partition.
3. First-boot rollback returns to build N if build N+1 fails to connect
   to the dashboard within 60 s.

### 14.7 Class + carrier emission

1. Every `r2.sensor.announce` payload carries CBOR key 11 (`class`,
   reverse-DNS) matching `trust_keys/sensor_class.txt` byte-for-byte.
2. Every `r2.sensor.announce` payload carries CBOR key 12 (`carrier`,
   board slug) matching the `[package.metadata.r2-workshop] carrier`
   field of the firmware's `Cargo.toml`.
3. Both fields are present from firmware v0.3+ (legacy firmware
   omits them — the dashboard treats absence as `class=unknown`,
   `carrier=unknown` and gates OTA accordingly).

## 15. Change log

| Date | Version | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-07 | 0.1 | Initial draft. Boot, FSM, sample pipeline, SD ring, network, battery, calibration, OTA, conformance. |

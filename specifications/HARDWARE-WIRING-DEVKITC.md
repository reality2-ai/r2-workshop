Soldering-ready wiring for the rocker-rig sensor node. Three phases, each
self-contained — you can stop after any phase and have a working sensor for
that phase's scope.

| Phase | Adds | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ADXL355 SPI only | Prove SPI bring-up; UART-monitored sample stream |
| 2 | microSD on shared SPI bus | Durable sample buffer (store-and-forward) |
| 3 | LiPo cell + charger + voltage divider | Battery operation + battery telemetry |

> **Power-on safety.** Disconnect USB before soldering. Verify each phase's
> wiring against the table below *before* re-applying power.

## 2. Phase 1 — ADXL355 over SPI (minimum viable sensor)

### 2.0 How to read the connection tables

The DevKitC-1 has **two ways** to identify a pin. The tables in this
document give you both, so you can cross-check:

| Identifier | Where you see it | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **GPIO number** | Silkscreened on the board itself, next to each pin | `10`, `11`, `G`, `3V3` |
| **Header pin position** | Datasheet only (not on the board); count sequentially from the top of the connector (USB end) | `J1 pin 16` = 16th pin down on the left header |

**Trust the silkscreen.** The GPIO number printed on the board is the
authoritative identifier — that's what your firmware sets. The "J1 pin N"
column is a counting aid when you can't read tiny silkscreen, or when the
silkscreen is hidden under a connector.

The numbering is **not sequential GPIO order** because the GPIO matrix is
flexible — Espressif put the pins where it suited the PCB layout, not in
numerical order. So GPIO9 and GPIO46 sit next to each other on the
silkscreen even though the numbers look out of order. That's normal.

If you're unsure, the labelled photo on PDF page 8
(`docs/esp-dev-kits-en-master-esp32s3.pdf`) shows every pin with its GPIO
number clearly visible.

### 2.1 Connection table

| ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (J1) | GPIO | Wire colour (suggested) | ADXL355-PMDZ (Pmod 12-pin) | Pmod signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pin 1**  (3V3)  | —      | Red    | **Pin 6** (or 12) | VDD |
| **Pin 22** (GND)  | —      | Black  | **Pin 5** (or 11) | DGND |
| **Pin 16** | GPIO10 | Yellow | **Pin 1**  | CS |
| **Pin 17** | GPIO11 | Green  | **Pin 2**  | MOSI |

### 2.2 Physical layout — DevKitC-1 J1 header

The six SPI signals fall on **adjacent pins** on the J1 (left) header — easy
ribbon-cable territory. View is from the top of the board, USB at the top:

```

### 2.3 Power, decoupling, cable

* ADXL355-PMDZ has onboard decoupling (10 nF + 100 nF across VDD/GND) — no
  extra cap needed at this end.
* DevKitC supplies 3.3 V at up to 100 mA from the onboard LDO. ADXL355 draws
  <200 µA — well within budget.
* Keep wires <15 cm if possible. SPI at 10 MHz on long unshielded jumpers can
  pick up noise; if you see CRC/WHO_AM_I errors, shorten or twist pairs (CLK
  with GND, MISO with GND).
* All signals are 3.3 V — **no level shifter required**.

### 2.4 Pre-power-up checklist

- [ ] No shorts: multimeter across 3V3↔GND on the DevKitC = open circuit.
- [ ] No shorts: 3V3↔GND on the ADXL355-PMDZ = open circuit.
- [ ] Continuity: J1 pin 1 ↔ Pmod pin 6 (red wire intact end-to-end).
- [ ] Continuity: J1 pin 22 ↔ Pmod pin 5 (black wire intact end-to-end).
- [ ] Pmod pin 1 (CS) goes to GPIO10, not GPIO11 (common mistake — count from the marked end).
- [ ] No connections to **strapping pins** GPIO0, GPIO3, GPIO45, GPIO46.
- [ ] No connections to USB pins GPIO19, GPIO20.
- [ ] No connections to UART0 pins GPIO43 (TX), GPIO44 (RX).

### 2.5 First power-up (smoke test, no firmware yet)

With USB plugged in:

1. The 3V3 power-on LED on the DevKitC should light.
2. Measure with multimeter: Pmod pin 6 reads 3.3 V ± 0.1 V.
3. ADXL355 idle current draw <1 mA (rest of the board dominates).

If 3.3 V is missing at the Pmod, you have a wire/solder issue — fix before
flashing firmware.

## 3. Phase 2 — microSD on shared SPI bus

The SD card sits on the **same SPI bus** as the ADXL355 (different CS line —
the firmware bus driver multiplexes). Six new wires.

### 3.1 Typical microSD breakout pinout

Most generic SPI breakouts (Adafruit, HiLetgo, generic Chinese) expose:
`VCC, GND, MISO, MOSI, SCK, CS, [CD]`. Confirm against your specific module.

### 3.2 Connection table

| ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (J1) | GPIO | microSD breakout pin | Signal | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pin 1**  (3V3)  | —      | VCC  | 3.3 V         | Most modules accept 3.3–5 V; 3.3 V is fine |
| **Pin 22** (GND)  | —      | GND  | Ground        | Share with ADXL355 GND |
| **Pin 19** | GPIO13 | MISO | Shared        | **Same wire as ADXL355 MISO** (T-junction OK) |
| **Pin 17** | GPIO11 | MOSI | Shared        | **Same wire as ADXL355 MOSI** |
| **Pin 18** | GPIO12 | SCK  | Shared        | **Same wire as ADXL355 SCLK** |
| **Pin 15** | GPIO9  | CS   | SD-only       | Dedicated chip-select |
| **Pin 8**  | GPIO15 | CD   | Card-detect (optional) | Skip if your module has no CD pin |

### 3.3 Notes

* SPI bus sharing: only the device whose CS is asserted responds. Both CS
  lines (GPIO9 for SD, GPIO10 for ADXL355) must be driven high (idle) when
  not in use — the firmware handles this automatically.
* SD cards typically want a 10 kΩ pull-up on CS (most breakouts include it).
* Bus speed reconciles per-device: ADXL355 ≤10 MHz, SD usually 25 MHz. The
  ESP-IDF SPI driver re-clocks per transaction.
* Keep the shared SPI wires bundled — long stub branches cause reflections.

## 4. Phase 3 — LiPo power input + battery sense

The sensor runs from a removable LiPo cell that is **never charged
in-circuit**. To recharge, the operator unplugs the cell at the JST-PH
connector and places it in an off-board charging dock; a freshly charged
cell is plugged back in. This keeps the sensor PCB free of charging
circuitry and lets the rig run continuously by hot-swapping cells (each
swap forces a cold boot — acceptable per the firmware FSM's resume path).

### 4.1 Topology

```
                                         3V3 (regulated)
   ┌──[JST-PH plug]──┐   ┌──────────────┐    ───────► DevKitC pin 1 (3V3)
   │   LiPo cell     ├───┤ buck-boost   │
   │ 3.0–4.2 V       │   │ 3.3 V out    ├──── GND  ── DevKitC pin 22
   └─────────────────┘   └──────────────┘
            │
            │  (raw cell voltage, before regulator)
            ├──── 100 kΩ ──┬─── GPIO4 (ADC1_CH3, battery sense)
            │              │
            │            100 kΩ
            │              │
            └──── GND ─────┘

   External: cell unplugs at JST-PH and is recharged in a separate
   single-cell LiPo charging dock. Charging is OUT OF SCOPE for this
   board — no charge controller, no charge inhibit, no thermistor.
```

The buck-boost regulator is REQUIRED because the LiPo cell ranges
3.0–4.2 V across its discharge curve and the DevKitC's onboard LDO
expects ≥ 4.5 V on the 5V pin. Feeding the 3V3 pin directly with a
regulated 3.3 V from a buck-boost is the cleanest path and bypasses the
onboard LDO. (An alternative is a 5 V step-up into the DevKitC's 5V
pin, which works but wastes power across the onboard LDO.)

The battery sense divider taps the **raw cell** (before the regulator)
so that the ADC reading reflects true cell voltage, not the regulated
output.

### 4.2 Battery voltage divider

Sample VBATT (3.0–4.2 V at the cell) into the ADC range (0–3.3 V):

```
   VBATT ──┬── R1 (100 kΩ) ──┬── ADC node ──── GPIO4 (J1 pin 4)
           │                  │
           │                 R2 (100 kΩ)
           │                  │
           │                 GND
           │
          [decoupling: 100 nF from ADC node to GND, REQUIRED]
```

> **The 100 nF bypass cap is not optional with this divider.** The ESP32-S3 ADC
> sample-and-hold needs a source impedance below ~10 kΩ to acquire the input
> voltage within its sample window. The Thévenin output of a 100 kΩ / 100 kΩ
> divider is 50 kΩ, so each ADC sample under-charges its internal cap by a
> random amount and readings scatter wildly (observed: 40–70 % of true value,
> 70 % spread between consecutive samples). The 100 nF cap bridges the ADC
> pin so the divider's current keeps it fully charged between samples; every
> ADC acquisition then starts from the true voltage. Without the cap the
> firmware's plausibility / variance filter (SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-SENSOR §8.1)
> rejects every reading and falls back to BatterySim — the operator sees
> simulated battery telemetry, not real cell voltage.
>
> If lower-value resistors are used (e.g. 10 kΩ / 10 kΩ, Thévenin = 5 kΩ),
> the cap becomes optional — the divider is then low-impedance enough on
> its own. The trade-off is ~210 µA quiescent vs ~21 µA, still trivial
> against a 2000 mAh cell.

Divider ratio = R2 / (R1 + R2) = 0.5. Cell voltage maps:

| Cell | ADC input | ADC reading (12-bit, 12 dB att.) |
|---|---|---|
| 4.20 V (full)   | 2.10 V | ≈ 2620 |
| 3.70 V (nominal)| 1.85 V | ≈ 2310 |
| 3.00 V (cut-off)| 1.50 V | ≈ 1870 |

Quiescent current: 4.2 V / 200 kΩ ≈ 21 µA continuous. Acceptable for a
2000 mAh cell (months of standby loss). For lower quiescent, gate the high
side with a MOSFET driven from a spare GPIO — defer to a v2 board.

### 4.3 Connection table

| Function                          | ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (J1) | GPIO | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Battery sense (divider mid-point) | **Pin 4** | GPIO4 (ADC1_CH3) | Must be ADC1 — ADC2 is unusable while WiFi active |
| 3V3 power input (from buck-boost) | **Pin 1** or **Pin 2** | — | Regulated 3.3 V; bypasses onboard LDO |
| GND (shared)                      | **Pin 22** | — | Common GND between cell, regulator, divider, DevKitC |

> **Power source rule.** Power the DevKitC from **either** USB **or** the
> battery's buck-boost output — never both at once. To flash while a
> battery is fitted, unplug the cell at the JST-PH first.

> **Hot-swap rule.** Cell swaps power-cycle the sensor. The firmware's
> FSM treats this as a cold boot and resumes streaming from
> `last_acked_seq + 1` once WiFi reconnects (per
> `SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-SENSOR` §6.6). No data is lost provided the SD ring
> retention exceeds the swap interval.

## 5. Pin reservation — full board (final)

Everything on the DevKitC after all three phases:

| GPIO | DevKitC pin | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPIO4  | J1 pin 4  | Battery sense | ADC1_CH3 |

The RGB LED is the primary user-facing status indicator. Reserved for
firmware use; no external wiring needed. Suggested state→colour mapping
(finalised in the firmware spec):

| Sensor state | LED |

| Boot / init | White, brief flash |
| Advertising (BLE beacon) | Blue, slow pulse (1 Hz) |
| BLE connected, WiFi joining | Cyan, fast pulse |
| Calibrating | Purple, solid |
| Streaming (live) | Green, heartbeat (60 bpm) |
| Streaming (catching up from SD) | Yellow, heartbeat |
| Low battery (<3.3 V) | Orange, slow pulse — overrides other states |
| Error / no SD / SPI fault | Red, fast pulse |
| OTA in progress | White, fast strobe |

**Free for future expansion** (Phase 4+ headroom):
GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO5, GPIO6, GPIO7, GPIO8, GPIO16, GPIO17, GPIO18, GPIO21,
GPIO39, GPIO40, GPIO41, GPIO42, GPIO47.

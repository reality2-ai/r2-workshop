Key distinctions:

* **One WebApp binary, two modes**: same WASM bundle from GitHub
  Pages, runs onsite (links to onsite host over hotspot) or remote
  (links via relay). Browser detects mode by which transport
  succeeds, or by an explicit operator-set flag.
* **Onsite mode is the privileged one**: the operator on the rig
  floor can Start/Mark/Stop a measurement session. Remote viewers
  are read-only by default — a remote viewer must not "upset a
  running experiment". This is enforceable via TG cert role
  (KeyHolder vs Member) plus a UI affordance (controls greyed out
  for remote).
* **Onsite host stores data locally** — independent of any cloud /
  relay. So an offline onsite session works without the internet,
  and survives even if the cloud server is unreachable.
* **Own relay + archive in one server** — eventually replaces the
  public `r2-relay` for this deployment. Same VPS forwards encrypted
  frames AND runs a TG-member archiver consumer that keeps the
  long-term store. (Public r2-relay is the bootstrap path; migrating
  to own server is a config swap, not an architecture change.)
* **TG membership: who joins how** —
  - **Sensors** (ESP32-S3): TG members **automatically** by their
    firmware build. The firmware bakes in `trust_keys/tg_pub.bin` via
    `include_bytes!` and generates its own per-device Ed25519 keypair
    in NVS on first boot (Phase 5a, done). No enrolment dance.
  - **Onsite controller** (the dashboard host): TG member
    **automatically** by config — it's the KeyHolder, holds
    `tg_priv.bin` off-tree at `~/.config/r2-workshop/tg_signer/`. It
    doesn't enrol; it issues enrolments.
  - **Browsers** (laptops, phones, tablets — anything that runs the
    WebApp): TG members **by the QR/link enrolment flow** below. This
    is the only path that uses one-time tokens.

* **Browser enrolment via QR / link** — **same model as r2-notekeeper**.
  Joining a WebApp requires either a link or a QR code (e.g. scan
  from a phone); there is no other way in. The onsite dashboard
  generates a one-time join token (single-use, ≤5 min expiry). The
  token is encoded into both:
  - a **QR code** displayed on the dashboard (operator points another
    device's camera at the screen), and
  - a **shareable link** of the form
    `https://reality2-ai.github.io/r2-workshop/?join=<token>`
    (operator emails / messages it).

  Either path opens the WebApp **and** triggers enrolment in the same
  step — the WASM hive reads `?join=` from the URL on first load,
  generates its keypair (IndexedDB), submits its public key + the
  token to the onsite host's KeyHolder endpoint over the relay, gets
  back a TG-signed device cert, becomes a member. From then on the
  device just works (cert persists in IndexedDB).

  Fallback: a manual "paste a join link" field in the WebApp's
  not-enrolled landing page, in case QR-scan / link-click both fail.

This shape supersedes the earlier separate Phase 5d (relay) +
Phase 5e (cloud archive) — they're one component now.

## What this project is

A **wireless sensor mesh for workshop and lab environments** — vibration,
temperature, pressure, strain. Edge intelligence detects anomalies and
alerts before something breaks.

The **driving deployment** (2026-05–onwards) is a half-tonne actuator-
driven tyre-wear test rig at the University of Auckland — the project
was originally named `r2-rocker` after that rig and renamed to
`r2-workshop` 2026-05-24 as the architecture and protocol surface
became general enough to serve other instrumentation jobs. The user
(roy.c.davies@ieee.org) is concerned that lateral motion is stressing
the rig's actuator joints toward shear failure; sensors detect that
lateral motion as a diagnostic. The data also feeds a paper / report.

**Hardware**: ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 + EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ + microSD breakout +
LiPo cell. Multiple sensor nodes (start: 2; later: dozens).
**Controlling device**: laptop or Raspberry Pi running a browser
dashboard.
**Protocol stack**: Reality2 (BLE bootstrap → trust group → WiFi → R2-WIRE
TCP) — vendored self-contained for university handoff.

4. `ensemble/{sensor,controller,viewer,keyholder}.yaml` — the four per-role R2-DEF §7 scores (a role is an ensemble; a hive performs one role). Notekeeper's B0 pattern: documents the runtime declaratively even though no loader yet consumes it. Companion: `specifications/SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-SENTANTS.md`.

**Canonical R2 specs lookup.** When work touches identity (the class
string, what kind of thing r2-workshop is), distribution (how an
ensemble gets to its devices), or build pipeline (firmware-from-YAML),
read these BEFORE drafting anything — they are the upstream
authority, not r2-workshop's own SPEC-* docs:

* `/mnt/data/Development/R2/r2-specifications/specs/r2-core/R2-ENSEMBLE.md`
  — what an ensemble is (sentants + plugins + UI registrations,
  distributed across hives, performed by the mesh, not installed).
  Class is `(name, class, version)` per §2.2.
* `/mnt/data/Development/R2/r2-specifications/specs/r2-core/R2-COMPILE.md`
  — how an ensemble's sentant YAML compiles AOT into firmware for
  constrained devices. Class declaration → beacon (§3.1); build
  targets (esp32 / nrf / rp2 / avr / linux-embedded) per §4.
* `/mnt/data/Development/R2/r2-specifications/specs/r2-core/R2-DEF.md`
  — the score schema (§7 specifically — Ensemble Definition Schema).
* `/mnt/data/Development/R2/r2-notekeeper/ensemble/ensemble.yaml`
  — canonical worked example (notekeeper).

## Working conventions (binding)

| # | Rule |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Spec before code.** Every firmware/dashboard change has a driving spec in `specifications/`. The spec wins disagreements unless the user re-opens. |
| 2 | **Conversation is research data.** Every session appends a new file `conversation/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-NN.md` — verbatim user, faithful AI, decisions table at the end. Never edit a closed session retroactively. |
| 3 | **Plan is consolidation.** `plan/PLAN.md` overwrites itself; conversation accumulates. |
| 4 | **Secrets stay out.** No private keys, no WiFi creds, no NVS dumps in the working tree. `.gitignore` blocks the patterns; *don't put them there in the first place* is the real rule. |
| 5 | **Cite sources.** Datasheet page, vendor URL, file:line for code refs — so the university can reconstruct reasoning without us. |

Project is **self-contained** — no path deps on `../r2-core`. R2 protocol
crates will be vendored into `crates/` when they're needed (Phase 4+
onwards). Don't add `path = "../../r2-core"` style references.

## Current state (2026-05-24)

**Released v0.2.0** (tag + GitHub release with `r2-workshop-firmware-
0.2.0-{devkitc,xiao}.bin` attached). Architectural milestone
landed across the day's session — bench-validated end-to-end:

* **Operator plane fully on R2-WIRE.** Every operator-action the
  webapp used to POST to `/api/*` (capture / reset / identify /
  bootstrap / alias / 5 access actions + 2 list reads) now rides as
  a `r2.dash.cmd.*` event on `/r2`. Status notifications
  (`peer.disconnected`, `dash.ota.progress`, `dash.reset.progress`,
  `dash.capture.progress`, `dash.access.event`, `dash.bootstrap.progress`,
  `dash.device.alias.changed`) likewise. Legacy `/ws/status` channel
  + ~14 orphaned `/api/*` operator routes retired.
* **Single port for all R2-WIRE.** Dashboard listener unified on
  port **21042** with peek-based protocol detection (R2-WIRE §13.5);
  same socket carries raw R2-WIRE TCP from sensors AND HTTP/`/r2`
  WebSocket from browsers. WS path renamed `/ws/raw` → `/r2`
  (R2-INTERNET §5).
* **Sensors are formal TG members** (Track A): every sensor now
  carries a KeyHolder-signed `DeviceCertificate` (147 bytes,
  NVS-persisted); dashboard verifies announce signatures under the
  TG public key — `sig=ValidWithCert` in the logs.
* **Webapp runs an `R2WorkshopHive`** (Track D) with a
  `DashboardViewerSentant`. Every `/r2` event flows through the
  sentant's per-sensor state in parallel with the JS UI handlers.

**Operator-facing polish landed alongside:**
* Capture file downloads stamp the device alias (or IP fallback)
  into both the **filename** (`<stem>__<dev>.csv`) and the **CSV
  column headers** (`seq,ts_ms,<dev>_x,<dev>_y,<dev>_z`) so a
  stack of single-sensor exports stays distinguishable.
* Acceleration decimated 10:1 **server-side before `/r2`** —
  Pi5 deployments no longer drown when the firmware streams at
  100 Hz × N sensors.
* BLE bootstrap loop's `get_active_sensor_ips` filters loopback so
  the operator's own browser WS isn't mistaken for a "streaming
  sensor" (a regression from the port unification, caught + fixed).
* Sensor TCP reads stable through accept (`socket2::SockRef` sets
  keepalive on the borrowed FD instead of doing a `tokio → std →
  tokio` round-trip that corrupted the connection after the
  protocol-detect peek).

**Architectural rule recorded (binding):** every byte that crosses
a hive boundary belongs to either an R2 event on R2-WIRE, or a
named plugin protocol owned by a (possibly nominal — spec-only)
sentant. Sentants are FSMs; the spec form is `state × incoming
event → state' × {emitted_events, plugin_actions}`. Implementations
may be raw tasks / listeners / HTTP routes — they just need to be
expressible as the sentant FSM the spec declares.

**Open bug carried (2026-05-18, untouched by today's work):**
Phase 5 pairing-over-relay. Off-network viewers can load the webapp
from `https://reality2.ai/r2-workshop/` (GitHub Pages); the "Anywhere"
QR encodes a relay URL; the page renders the "Pair this device"
landing. The phone's `access.request` (sent as a binary
`R2C\x01`-magic control frame, since r2-relay drops unrecognised
text frames) is **not yet reaching the controller's Link tab**.
Diagnostic logging in `dashboard/src/relay.rs` is in place; cached
webapp on the phone is the most likely cause. In-room pairing is
the working baseline.

In-room path remains the working baseline: invite modal has an
In-room ↔ Anywhere toggle below the dashboard QR; In-room shows
both the WiFi-join QR and the dashboard QR; viewer pairs by
emitting a `r2.dash.cmd.access.request` event on `/r2` (since
v0.2 — pre-v0.2 was a POST `/api/access/request`), operator
approves on the Link tab (which fires `r2.dash.cmd.access.approve`).
Tested working end-to-end.

**Earlier state preserved (2026-05-08):** Wireless end-to-end demo
alive on real hardware. ESP32-S3 sensor (still ADXL-simulated;
soldering imminent) BLE-advertises, accepts a signed `#wifi_offer`
over L2CAP from the dashboard's bootstrap loop, persists creds to
NVS, reboots, joins WiFi, opens TCP, streams R2-WIRE frames. The
dashboard decodes, decimates 100→10 Hz for the WASM viewer at
`/v/`, and lights both physical RGB LED and dashboard's virtual
LEDs in lockstep through every FSM state. Firmware updates push
wirelessly via `/api/ota/{addr}` — the USB cable is unplugged for
entire bench sessions. Same chip MAC `1c:db:d4:41:28:3c`.

## Sentant / plugin / ensemble — AOT compilation reconciliation

**The 2026-05-07 conformance audit** (`audits/2026-05-07-conformance-audit.md`)
identified that r2-workshop's firmware and dashboard are monolithic
Rust processes rather than sentants composed by `r2-engine` at
runtime. This LOOKS like a conformance gap against R2-SENTANT /
R2-PLUGIN / R2-ENSEMBLE — but reconciles cleanly through R2-BUILD /
R2-COMPILE's AOT-compilation path.

The R2 model: a sentant ensemble can be either **interpreted** (loaded
into `r2-engine` at runtime, the browser-hive way) or **AOT-compiled**
(the firmware way: sentant YAML → native code → flashed binary).
Conformance is about the externally-observable behaviour (R2-WIRE
frames, R2-FNV-named events, R2-TRUST signatures), not about the
runtime form.

Under this lens:

* `firmware/esp32-s3/` is a **manually AOT-compiled sensor sentant**
  with notional plugin boundaries (accelerometer driver, battery,
  SD-storage, WiFi, identity, OTA). Conformant.
* `dashboard/` is a **manually AOT-compiled dashboard ensemble** with
  bridge / KeyHolder / archive / calibration roles. Conformant.
* The "gap" is really a **documentation gap**: we haven't yet
  authored the `r2-workshop.ensemble.yaml` (per R2-DEF §7) that
  describes the compile-time composition. Phase 5d-ensemble in
  PLAN.md.

**Implication for future work**: Phase 5d-ensemble does NOT mean
"rewrite the firmware to use `r2-engine` at runtime." It means
"author the YAML that documents what the binary already does." The
browser WASM hive (Phase 5d step 4) IS the interpreted half of the
ensemble; the firmware can stay AOT-compiled.

## Architectural commitments worth knowing

* **The remote browser IS a hive — not a thin viewer of a remote
  server.** This is the architectural model `r2-notekeeper` and
  `anthill` already use: there is no remote Rust web server serving
  "data" to the browser. The full R2 stack runs *inside the browser*
  via WASM (`r2-core/crates/r2-wasm/` exposes FNV, CBOR, R2-WIRE,
  R2-TRUST, R2-ROUTE, R2-TRANSPORT, R2-ENGINE through `wasm-bindgen`),
  and the browser is itself a TG member: holds its own keypair +
  TG-signed cert, decrypts + verifies frames, talks peer-to-peer
  with other TG members through the relay.

  **Phase 5d is REPLACE, not AUGMENT** — the existing Axum-served
  HTML+JS dashboard goes away. The Rust process stays only for: (a)
  sensor TCP listener, (b) relay-compatible WSS forwarding raw R2-WIRE
  bytes to connected browser hives, (c) TG KeyHolder cert issuance,
  (d) local data archive (Phase 5f). It no longer decodes frames or
  serves HTML/JSON. The browser is the canonical viewer in both
  onsite and remote modes — same WebApp binary either way.

  **Why do this now rather than retrofit later** (user, 2026-05-07):
  the longer the current Rust-server-decoded model is in use, the
  more accumulated state it picks up — calibration storage, joint
  groups, session history, per-peer metadata — and the harder it
  gets to migrate to the WASM-hive model without breaking saved data
  or rewriting half the code twice. Migrating before that drift
  accumulates is the cheaper path. Phase 5b's Rust-side announce
  verification is acknowledged as transitional — the same logic
  re-emerges in WASM during 5d, just compiled differently.

  Hosts at deployment of Phase 5d:

  | Host | Role | Why this host |
  |---|---|---|
  | GitHub Pages (or any static CDN) | Serves the `webapp/` bundle (HTML + JS + .wasm). Updated via `git push`. | Static hosting for the **remote** path. Public, cacheable, no execution, no plaintext, no secrets. |
  | Onsite controller | Hosts its own copy of the same `webapp/` bundle on its unified R2 port (e.g. `http://10.42.0.1:21042/` — same port as the raw-TCP sensor listener post-v0.2 unification per R2-WIRE §13.5). Plus: relay-compatible WSS forwarder + TG KeyHolder cert issuance + local data archive (Phase 5f). | Lets onsite browsers get the WebApp **without internet** — open a tablet on the hotspot, browse to the controller's IP, scan the QR from the same dashboard's "Enrol device" UI, join TG. Closed-network deployments work end-to-end. |
  | r2-relay (e.g. $5 VPS) | Forwards TG-encrypted frames between members over WSS. Sees no plaintext. | Public-internet rendezvous so remote browsers can reach the controller across NAT. Skipped when everything's onsite on the hotspot. |

  Both bundles are byte-identical (same `cargo build --target wasm32`
  output) — operator-discretion which host the QR/link points at:
  GitHub URL for remote viewers, controller-local URL for onsite
  viewers. Same WebApp either way.

  The remote browser loads the static page from GitHub, opens a WSS
  to the relay using its enrolled TG cert, and is then an active
  member of the rocker-rig TG. Updates to the viewer = `git push`;
  updates to the protocol stack = `r2-wasm` rebuild + push.

  **Layering inside the browser** (same split as the current local
  dashboard's server/JS split, just relocated):

  | Layer | Purpose |
  |---|---|
  | WASM | Protocol + crypto: frame decode/encode, HMAC verify, TG key derivation (HKDF), cert validation, Ed25519 sig checks, R2-WIRE state, per-event dispatch. |
  | Plain JavaScript | UX: DOM, Chart.js, layout, event handlers, calibration wizard, joint-group editor, the Devices view, the LED animations. |

  **Same deployment shape as `r2-notekeeper`.** When implementing
  Phase 5d, study notekeeper's enrolment flow + per-device cert
  management; we inherit the proven UX rather than designing fresh.

  **Prior art note.** A generic trust-group management tool was
  attempted earlier in the R2 project but never completed. We
  shouldn't try to reinvent it — `r2-notekeeper` is the working
  reference for joining + revocation + per-device cert state, and
  that's what to crib from for r2-workshop's Phase 5d-enrol.

* **Each remote browser is its own enrolled TG member** — not a copy
  of the dashboard's keys. Per `r2-trust` SPEC §2, each browser
  generates its own Ed25519 keypair on first run (persisted in
  IndexedDB), gets a TG-signed device certificate via a one-time
  enrolment flow (operator presents a join code on the onsite
  dashboard's UI; the browser submits it back along with its public
  key; the dashboard's TG KeyHolder issues a cert binding device_pk
  to the TG with role + expiry). Browser then presents that cert
  when subscribing to the relay. Cert revocation lives with the TG
  KeyHolder (onsite). This means: stolen laptop → revoke its cert,
  no need to re-key the whole TG. Same trust semantics as the
  sensors (each sensor has its own keypair + TG cert), just on a
  different platform.

## Dashboard scaling target (binding)

**1 sensor today, 20+ sensors at full deployment.** Every Phase 8
deliverable shall stay smooth + readable across that range:

* CSS grid auto-fit (cards reflow from 1 column → 6+ columns).
* Cards collapse to summary tiles when count > ~8 visible.
* Canvas-based mini-charts (Plotly per-peer ≠ scalable).
* Offscreen cards pause their chart loops.
* Health-summary header shows aggregate state at a glance.
* Sorting + filtering (by joint, by status, by needs-update).
* Virtualised list past ~30 peers if browser jank shows.

Confirmed by user 2026-05-07: "in time there could be 20 or so, so
the dashboard has to expand automatically." Per
`SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-DASHBOARD` §12.1.

## Dashboard UX direction (Phase 8 captured intent)

The dashboard grows three views (operator picks via a tab/toggle):

| View | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| **Live charts** | Real-time x/y/z per sensor — what we have today | (delivered in 0L) |
| **Devices** | Fleet-status overview: per-sensor online state, battery, fw_ver, last-seen, FSM state, **virtual LED** mirroring the hardware RGB LED (colour + animation per `HARDWARE-WIRING.md` §5), and an **"Update Firmware"** button per card (stub → real OTA in Phase 9) | 8a |
| **Joints** | Diagnostic view: pairwise differential lateral motion, stress indicator per joint, long-term trend chart | 8c |
| **Sessions** | Named measurement sessions: define / start / stop, capture participating sensors + calibration snapshot + per-joint traces + operator notes; replay + export. Storage in browser IndexedDB (browser-hive owns it); shared across TG-member browsers via relay; archived long-term by cloud consumer (5e). | 8d |

The virtual-LED is a one-line addition once Phase 5L is in: firmware
already tracks FSM state internally for the physical LED; just include
the state in `r2.sensor.status`. The browser's CSS animations
(solid / pulse / heartbeat / strobe) match the physical LED 1:1.

## R2-specifications conformance — recurring gate

Every protocol-touching phase (5c HMAC envelope, 5d WASM port, 6 BLE
bootstrap) and every release candidate **must cross-validate against
the canonical specs in `../r2-specifications/specs/r2-core/`** before
landing. We have THREE places that encode R2-WIRE / R2-CBOR / sign
HMACs: firmware (inline encoder in `firmware/esp32-s3/src/wire.rs`),
the onsite controller's Rust process (using `crates/r2-cbor` +
`crates/r2-wire`), and eventually the WASM hive (using `r2-wasm`'s
exposed `encode_compact_frame` etc.). All three MUST produce
byte-identical bytes for the same inputs — that's the test.

Mechanism: `testing/wire-vectors.json` (per `SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-WIRE.md`
§9) lists `(event_name, payload, expected_frame_hex,
expected_hmac_hex, expected_sig_hex)` tuples. Firmware unit tests +
dashboard unit tests + WASM unit tests all check against it. CI
runs all three on every push.

Note: not a one-shot deliverable. It's a gate. Phase Z in PLAN.md.

## Performance — WASM/TG live-streaming budget

Asked + analysed 2026-05-07: is the WASM/TG model fast enough for
live streaming?

**Yes, by 2+ orders of magnitude on the figures we care about.**
The hot path per acceleration frame (WSS bytes → WASM decode → CBOR
parse → HMAC verify → JS event → Chart.js update) totals ~15 µs of
WASM work plus Chart.js's render cost. At the spec'd 10 Hz live
decimation × 20 sensors = 200 events/sec the WASM side is ~3 ms/sec
CPU — well under 1% of a single core on a modern laptop.

Bottleneck is and stays Chart.js render time at high peer counts,
which Phase 8b (Canvas mini-charts) already addresses. WASM does not
add meaningful overhead vs the current Rust-decode-then-JSON-push
model — and JSON serialisation on the server side is usually MORE
expensive than CBOR decode on the client.

Risks documented for completeness:

* Full 100 Hz to browser pre-decimation would hurt — keep the
  onsite controller's 10 Hz live decimation in place after Phase 5d.
* Per-frame Ed25519 sig would be expensive (~500 µs each); we only
  Ed25519-verify the announce. Per-frame integrity is HMAC (~10 µs).
* Mobile-browser WASM is slower but still trivial at 10 Hz × small N.
* First-load bundle size: r2-wasm ≈ 200–400 KB compressed. One-time
  cost; cached after first visit.

Validated externally by r2-notekeeper and anthill running this exact
model in production today.

## Lessons learned the hard way (carry these forward)

* **esp-idf-sys + custom partition table**: ESP-IDF resolves
  `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_CUSTOM_FILENAME` relative to esp-idf-sys's
  auto-generated build directory, not the crate root. Solution:
  `firmware/esp32-s3/build.rs` walks up to find the `esp-idf-sys-*/out/`
  directory and copies `partitions.csv` there. First-build chicken-
  and-egg solved by `tools/setup-firmware.sh`. Rebuild a SECOND time
  if a clean rebuild produces the default 1-app layout.
* **NetworkManager auto-reverts AP profile**: bringing up
  `r2-workshop-ap` on the USB adapter works, but if NM later auto-
  reconnects the same interface to a regular network (e.g. on a
  reboot or NM restart), the AP profile drops silently. Re-run
  `tools/setup-hotspot.sh` to bring it back up.
* **R2-WIRE compact frame layout** is 12-byte header (per spec), not
  the 7-byte custom header the M10 demo dashboard had hardcoded. The
  dashboard parser was fixed in this session — check both
  decoder sites if porting any further r2-core dashboard code.
* **Schema rename**: M10's `acceleration` → ours `r2.sensor.acceleration`,
  `battery_status` → `r2.sensor.battery`. Server-side `remap_payload`
  in `dashboard/src/main.rs` translates integer-keyed CBOR to friendly
  named keys.
* **Dashboard expects `name` for hostname**; our spec uses `hostname`.
  The dashboard tries both for compat.
* **Decimation matters**: 100 Hz to the browser is too fast — Chart.js
  drops frames + the broadcast channel fills. Per
  `SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-DASHBOARD` §5.2, we decimate to 10 Hz on the wire to
  the browser; full rate goes to the SD ring (when Phase 3 lands).
* **Two repo paths**: `/mnt/data/Development/R2/r2-workshop` and
  `/home/roycdavies/Development/R2/r2-workshop` resolve to the same
  inode (one is a symlink). Don't be confused by the dual paths.
* **L2CAP `#wifi_offer` framing** (Phase 6 debug, 2026-05-08):
  `r2-bootstrap` (controller) prepends a single R2-WIRE FrameHeader
  byte BEFORE the compact frame to support fragmented sends.
  `r2-esp::l2cap` strips the 2-byte length prefix but NOT the
  FrameHeader byte. Firmware must `r2_wire::FrameHeader::decode(data[0])`
  + `&data[1..]` before calling `decode_compact`, otherwise event_hash
  reads from the wrong offset and misses the real `#wifi_offer` hash
  by exactly one byte (the symptom we hit was `0x0d01f776` instead
  of `0x01f77656`).
* **`r2.sensor.announce` only fires on TCP (re)connect.** A viewer
  that connects to `/r2` mid-session misses the announce and
  therefore `fw_ver`, `device_pk`, `boot_ts_ms` — device card stays
  showing `—`. Fix is server-side: cache the most-recent announce
  raw frame per peer, replay on every new `/r2` connect (done in
  the dashboard's `handle_ws_raw`).
* **TCP keepalive isn't fast enough** for "sensor reset → dashboard
  notices" UX. Linux's default takes ~60 s. We added a 5 s read-
  timeout in `handle_sensor_connection`'s read loop — silence for
  longer than that is treated as disconnect, `peer_disconnected`
  broadcast fires immediately, viewer's virtual LED grays out.
* **OTA-rollback gate**: the firmware MUST NOT call
  `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` until it has demonstrated
  it can talk to the dashboard. Spec §12.2 wants "first dashboard
  ACK"; v0.1 settles for "first successful frame round-trip" —
  `mark_app_valid` lives in `sender::Sender::session()` after the
  first `send_sample()` returns Ok. A WiFi-up-but-can't-reach-dashboard
  firmware never marks valid → bootloader rolls back. Don't move
  this back to main.rs.
* **WS2812 brightness**: undiffused at full RGB is genuinely
  retinopathic in a room. `BRIGHTNESS = 0.20` in `firmware/esp32-s3/
  src/led.rs` is the calm-tech-ambient cap. Don't dial it back up
  without a diffuser.

## Binding architecture decisions

Don't relitigate these without explicit user re-opening:

0. **Trust topology — TWO trust groups, related by bilateral
   entanglement** (R2-TRUST §7.5). Production TG = sensors + active
   controller. Viewing TG = operator phones / tablets / laptops /
   observers. The controller is the bridge sentant — production-side
   implementation of the entanglement scope (`SPEC-R2-WORKSHOP-BRIDGE.md`).
   No hive belongs to both TGs simultaneously (R2-TRUST §2.3). This
   is the **first R2 deployment of entanglement**, so the rocker work
   is also a foundational implementation of R2-TRUST §7 — see
   `memory/project_two_tgs_entangled.md`,
   `memory/project_rocker_exercises_r2_layers.md`.
0a. **KeyHolder is a separable role from controller.** The KeyHolder
   holds the TG private key, signs offers / certs / OTA images. The
   controller hosts the dashboard / TCP listener / archive. Same
   physical laptop in v0.1; future deployments may separate them.
0b. **Multi-KeyHolder, one active at a time.** Multiple devices CAN
   hold the TG private key (via export/import flow). Only one acts
   as the live KeyHolder at any moment per R2-TRUST §5.5 Key Holder
   Transfer. Failover is operator-managed, not protocol-level — see
   `memory/project_controller_is_fixed_per_experiment.md`.
1. **Hardware**: ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 + EVAL-ADXL355-PMDZ + microSD + LiPo.
2. **Wiring**: SPI2/FSPI defaults (CS=GPIO10, MOSI=11, SCLK=12, MISO=13,
   DRDY=14) + SD CS=GPIO9 + battery sense=GPIO4 (ADC1_CH3) via 100k/100k
   divider. RGB LED on GPIO38 (v1.1) as status indicator.
3. **Sample rate**: default 100 Hz; NVS-tunable up to 4 kHz.
4. **g-range**: default ±2 g; NVS-tunable.
5. **SD card is primary durable log** — TCP is a near-real-time tap, not
   the source of truth. Producer / consumer / ack tasks. Ring overwrite-
   oldest at full.
6. **Sample record** (SD + wire): 20 bytes fixed: `(seq:u32, ts_ms:u32,
   x:i32, y:i32, z:i32)`.
7. **Two wire encodings**: `r2.sensor.acceleration` (live, per-sample)
   and `r2.sensor.acceleration.batch` (catch-up, ~50 samples per frame).
8. **Cumulative ACK**: dashboard sends `r2.dash.ack {through_seq:N}` every
   200 ms or 100 samples; sensor advances ring head on receipt.
9. **Calibration**: per-sensor two-position rest method
   (g_A, g_B → main = norm(g_B−g_A), vertical = norm((g_A+g_B)/2),
   sideways = main × vertical, R = [main; sideways; vertical]).
   **Calibration matrix lives on dashboard**, keyed by device public key,
   persisted to `dashboard/calibration.json`.
10. **Trust group**: hardwired via compile-time `include_bytes!` from
    `trust_keys/tg_pub.bin`. Per-device Ed25519 in NVS, generated first boot.
11. **Diagnostic model**: structural health monitoring via **differential
    lateral motion between sensors across joints**. Initial deployment is
    **topology B**: 1 sensor per actuator joint (2 sensors total). Future:
    pairs across each joint, plus bed sensors as reference channel for
    environmental subtraction.
12. **Sensor mounting role** is dashboard-side schema (`rocker / bed /
    other`) — affects calibration treatment and analytics, not firmware.
13. **OTA**: TCP-push with SHA-256 verify; signing with TG key is a
    follow-up. SD card holds last-known-good firmware backup.
14. **Time sync**: monotonic per-device `ts_ms` + `r2.dash.sync_pulse`
    (Cristian's algorithm) for cross-sensor alignment, ~5 ms accuracy.

## When the user says…

* **"Add this to the wiring"** → edit `specifications/HARDWARE-WIRING.md`,
  bump version, add change-log entry.
* **"Let's start coding"** → check spec exists for the part being coded;
  if not, write the spec first (PROCESS.md rule 1).
* **"Generate the trust group"** → off-tree, on the signing host; only
  copy `tg_pub.bin` + `tg_cert.bin` into `trust_keys/`. See
  `SECRETS-POLICY.md`.
* **"Add a feature for X"** → ask whether it should land in firmware or
  dashboard; default dashboard for analytics, firmware only for things
  that must run on-device.
* **"Save the conversation"** → append a new file in `conversation/` with
  today's date and a `-NN.md` suffix.

## What NOT to do

* Don't add `path = "../r2-core"` deps. The repo is self-contained.
* Don't write the TG private key into `trust_keys/`. Public material only.
* Don't commit `wifi_config.toml`. Only `.example` is committed.
* Don't relitigate the 14 binding decisions above without explicit
  user re-opening.
* Don't summarise what you just did at the end of every response — the
  user reads the diff. Tight end-of-turn summaries (one or two sentences)
  per the system prompt.

//! `R2WorkshopHive` — wasm-bindgen entry point for the rocker webapp.
//! Sibling of `R2Hive` (`hive.rs`); both share the same r2-engine
//! EventBus shape but register different sentants.
//!
//! Track D of the R2-conformance roadmap (see
//! `audits/2026-05-23-architectural-gaps.md` Finding C). The rocker
//! webapp constructs a `R2WorkshopHive` at boot, forwards every R2-WIRE
//! event the dashboard publishes on `/ws/raw` into it via
//! `send_event(hash, payload)`, and reads the resulting per-sensor
//! state via `peek_state()`. JS continues to own UI rendering for
//! v0.1 (this slice is observation-only); a future slice transitions
//! the UI to render from `peek_state()` directly, then Tracks B+C
//! migrate the wire shape itself.
//!
//! ## Why both `R2Hive` and `R2WorkshopHive` in one crate?
//!
//! Each browser deployment instantiates exactly one hive (a tab is a
//! single TG-member device). The crate ships both wasm-bindgen
//! constructors so the rocker webapp picks `R2WorkshopHive::new()` and
//! the notekeeper webapp picks `R2Hive::new()`. Sharing the WASM
//! bundle is fine — the cost is negligible (a few kB of sentant code
//! per variant) and avoids parallel build/deploy plumbing.

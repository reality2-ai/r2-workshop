#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tools/build-firmware.sh — build the ESP32-S3 firmware for a chosen
# carrier, package the OTA-ready application image (.bin), AND archive
# a copy under `firmware/esp32-s3/<carrier>/releases/<fw_ver>.bin` for
# git-tracked posterity.
#
# `cargo espflash flash` does the ELF→app-image conversion internally
# when flashing over USB, but doesn't write the .bin to disk; the OTA
# receiver (r2-esp::ota_tcp) needs the same image format on the wire,
# so this script runs `espflash save-image` after the build.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/build-firmware.sh                # defaults to devkitc
#   tools/build-firmware.sh devkitc
#   tools/build-firmware.sh xiao
#
# After this completes:
# * Latest build artifact (overwritten on each run) is at
#   `firmware/esp32-s3/<carrier>/target/xtensa-esp32s3-espidf/release/r2-workshop-firmware.bin`
#   — push this via /api/ota/{addr}.
# * Versioned archive copy lives at
#   `firmware/esp32-s3/<carrier>/releases/r2-workshop-firmware-<fw_ver>.bin`
#   — `git add` this when you want to record the release for posterity.
#   The filename matches the `fw_ver` string the firmware bakes into
#   `r2.sensor.announce`, so a sensor's reported version is searchable
#   directly against the releases directory.

# Trust-Group key guard. The firmware embeds trust_keys/tg_pub.bin
# at compile time via include_bytes!. Two failure modes to catch
# before kicking off a 30 s xtensa build:
#
#   1. No tg_pub.bin / tg_cert.bin at all — fresh clone, no deployment
#      keys yet. The build would fail late with an include_bytes!
#      error; we'd rather print actionable setup instructions early.
#
#   2. tg_pub.bin is the canonical upstream demo key. Identifiable
#      by SHA-256 against a hash recorded under
#      `trust_keys/.tg_pub_demo_sha256`. Building against this key
#      means every lab that clones the public repo gets the same TG
#      embedded, which only works for the one deployment that owns
#      the matching tg_priv.bin. Per
#      audits/2026-05-23-architectural-gaps.md (post-handoff
#      recommendation), refuse this case so the new lab is forced
#      to keygen first.

This deployment has no Trust Group keys, or is still on the upstream
demo keys. Each r2-workshop deployment needs its own keypair — sensors
verify their certs against the public key baked into the firmware at
build time, so cloning the repo and re-using the committed key would
mean every lab shares a TG identity (whoever holds the matching
private key is the only one who can sign certs).

Generate a fresh TG keypair for this deployment (one-time per lab):

    cd "$REPO_ROOT" && cargo run -p r2-workshop-tg --release -- init

That writes:
  trust_keys/tg_pub.bin            (committed; embedded into firmware)
  trust_keys/tg_cert.bin           (committed; self-signed KeyHolder cert)
  ~/.config/r2-workshop/tg_signer/tg_priv.bin   (off-tree; read by dashboard)

After it completes, re-run this script. See SECRETS-POLICY.md for the
full key-handling policy.
